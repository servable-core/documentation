### Servable server
The Servable server acts as a central orchestrator and mediator. It computes the target schema, calls for a database migration if needed, loads protocols, registers seeding, configuration, routes, jobs, etc.

### Protocols
Servable streamlines the server development by separating every "groupable" logic to be a protocol, so that it is organically extracted from the base code and possibly migrated into its own package. By doing so, Servable enforces a clear separation of concerns pattern out of the box. 
[More](./protocols)

Just like a docker image is made to be platform agnostic, a protocol is designed to be as independent as possible from the current environment it's being used in. A protocol might depend on other protocols, but it does not need to know which application it is used for, or call any of its API, unless they are registered as a **Service**

### Framework engine
The framework engine is a bridge to a more traditional Node JS framework. It conforms to Servable's [engine APIs](./engines). By separating the actual implementation from the high level object manipulation, the Servable framework allows for a high reusability of your server and protocols code from the get-go.
