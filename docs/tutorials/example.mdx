# Example

This example will walk you through the building of a fully functional servable app.
The source code is available at [https://github.com/servable-community/sample](https://github.com/servable-community/sample)

We want to build a Servable service that:
- #TODO

## 1. Install the generator

<BashTabs npm={"npm install -g generator-servable"} />

## 2. Generate a new server

Generate a new servable app by running the command:

```bash
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
yo servable -q -t app -n "MyApp"
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

You will be prompted to enter the basic informations needed to start a full-fledged servable app.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run servable.

## 3. Start your server

Run the development server:

<BashTabs yarn={"yarn start"} />

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created servable-parse app, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `yarn start` command builds your app locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:1391/.


You can now open the Servable dashboard at [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040) and view your application data.

:::info
Note that contrarily to Parse Server Dashboard, Servable Dashboard does not permit class creation and modification via the UI. 
This is to enforce the unique ability of Servable to predict schema and handle migrations automatically, thus avoiding environment discrepancies.
The sole source of truth is the protocols designated schema files.
:::

## 4. Add a class

At this point the app is fully functional but lacks any high level behavior.
By default a Servable service contains the following models: *_User, _Session, _Installation, ServableApp*
Add a custom class:

```bash
yo servable -q -t class -n "BlogPost"
```

:::note
You can add class manually by adding a class payload to the app/schema/1.0.0/index.json
:::

Restart the app to reflect the changes:
<BashTabs yarn={"yarn stop \nyarn start"} />

## 5. Add protocols

We want to make:
- The app (thus servableApp class) able to send notifications and emails, have a reference for countries, locales and currency 
```bash
yo servable -q -t communityprotocol --useAppProtocol --targetClassName ServableApp --protocol notifiable
```

- The user (thus _User class) be followable, slugable, avatarable, localable, countryable
```bash
yo servable -q -t communityprotocol --useAppProtocol --targetClassName _User --protocol notifiable
```

- A blog post (thus BlogPost class) to be commentable, reviewable, publishable, localable, countryable, slugable
We want to Add a community protocol to the ServableApp to give it 
```bash
yo servable -q -t communityprotocol --useAppProtocol --targetClassName BlogPost --protocol notifiable
```
At this point the app is useful for blogging.

Restart the app to reflect the changes:
<BashTabs yarn={"yarn stop \nyarn start"} />


# Uninstall

<BashTabs npm={"npm uninstall -g generator-servable"} />
